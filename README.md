#Bookmark+

![alt tag](img/ext-icon-128.png)

Bookmark+ is a book mark chrome extension that doesn't suck. Save exactly what you want with one click! Bookmarked content will appear as they should, rather than just a plain URL.

Just right click on the content you want to save on the page, bookmark+ will do the rest. Currently, bookmark plus spports:

- Image, right click an image. Image will be directly visible from bookmark+ folder
- Quote, select a paragraph and then right click. Selected paragraph will be directly visible from bookmark+ folder
- Video (Youtube only), right click on any blank space for a youtube video. Video will be directly visible from folder
- Page, right click on any page, the url will be saved the old way.
